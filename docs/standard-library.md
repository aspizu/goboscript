# Standard Library

The standard library is a collection of useful procedures, functions and macros that
can be used in any goboscript project.

## Standard library headers

Include a header using the `%include` directive.

```goboscript
%include std/math
```

goboscript's dead code elimination will remove any unused procedures and functions from
the compiled project.

## Documentation

There is no hand-written documentation currently, so refer to AI-generated documentation.
